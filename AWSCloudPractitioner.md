EC2:
	 **Instance Types:**
	 - General purpose - ==balance== of compute memory and networking resources
	 - Compute optimized - Ideal for compute-bound apps that benefit from ==high-performance processors== 
	 - Memory optimized - deliver fast performance for workloads that process large datasets in memory. 
	 - Accelerated computing - use hardware accelerators, or coprocessors, to perform some ==functions more efficiently== than is possible in software running on CPU's.
	 - Storage optimized - designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to large ==datasets== on local storage.
	**Pricing:**
	 - On-demand - ideal for short term, irregular workload that cannot be interrupted. No upfront costs or min. contracts apply. Instances run continuously


Elastic Load Balancing(ELB):
	Regional construct - runs at regional level
	Automatically scalable - no change to cost
	Decoupled architecture - front end doesn't know about back end
